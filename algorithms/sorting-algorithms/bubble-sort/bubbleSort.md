# Bubble sort

A simple sorting algorithm based on comparing two adjacent elements. If the number on the left side is smaller than the number on the right side (descending order) or the left side is larger than the right side (ascending order), the elements are swapped. Iteration moves the smallest/largest element to the end of the array. The same procedure is applied to the next iteration without the last element. After n-1 iterations we get a sorted array.

Time complexity - $O(n^2)$

Stable - yes

Speed - very slow
